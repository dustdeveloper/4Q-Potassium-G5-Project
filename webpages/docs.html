        <h1>(barebones) Game Documentation</h1>
        <p>This document provides overview on the controls of the game and the game's scenarios.</p>
        <h2>Controller Overview</h2>
        <p>There are only <strong>4</strong> keys that help in controlling the system, being: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q :</strong> Open the COMMAND modal</li>
            <li><strong>W :</strong> Select ALL UNITS</li>
            <li><strong>O :</strong> Select ONE UNIT (current unit selected)</li>
            <li><strong>P :</strong> Send COMMAND</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Possible Scenarios</h2>
        <p>Two values affect the system: <strong>coolant_in_flow and coolant_out_flow.</strong> When combined, they make <strong>_coolant_amount_rate</strong> that gets added to the main <strong>coolant_amount.</strong> <br> Positive values add to the amount, and vice versa for the Negative values.</p>
        <p>When handling the system, it is advised that you must carefully read the REF VALUE located in any ACTIVE LOG.</p>
        <p> EXAMPLE: "Warning detected at UNIT 05 [REF :: AAA_45655]" "Signal detected at UNIT 01 [REF :: DEAD]"</p>
        <p>The current scenarios are possible with the system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DISCONNECTED :</strong> This unit is recognized to be DISCONNECTED. Nothing can be done to restore it.</li>
            <li><strong>AAA_0001:</strong> Chamber pressure is above the safety threshold (chamber_pressure > 7) <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempt to LOWER the coolant_amount by making lower base.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>AAA_0002:</strong> Power input is under the safety threshold (power_in < 400)
                <ul>
                    <li>Attempt to RESTORE the coolant_amount by making higher base (Not higher than 1).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>AAA_0003:</strong> Unit state changed to "chamber_damage". Cannot be reverted.
